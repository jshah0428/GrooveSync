# Groove Sync

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Groove Sync came from the Hackathon's theme. We aimed to introduce users unfamiliar with disco to this influential genre, enhancing their music literacy. To create an immersive experience, we incorporated key disco symbols like the disco ball, flashing lights, and vibrant colors. The choose-your-own-adventure feature was inspired by similar storytelling formats, allowing users to take control of their journey and experience the personal element of discovery.

## What It Does
### Disco-Themed UI
The user interface is designed to immerse users in the disco era, with vibrant colors, flashing lights, and iconic elements like the disco ball, creating a nostalgic, lively atmosphere.

### Educational Disco History
Groove Sync provides users with an interactive experience to learn about the history of the disco genre, including its cultural impact, key artists, and iconic tracks.

### DiscoAI Chatbot
An AI-powered chatbot designed to answer users' questions about disco. Whether they want to know about the origins of the genre, famous disco songs, or key cultural moments, DiscoAI is there to guide them.

### Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Game
This interactive game places users in the shoes of a musician during the disco era, allowing them to make choices that shape their journey. It adds a storytelling element and gives users control over their own "disco destiny."

### Spotify Integration
Users can explore and listen to popular disco tracks directly through the platform, and they have the option to add their favorite songs to their Spotify playlists, making it easy to continue enjoying disco music outside the app.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
We are proud of our accomplishments with Groove Sync, including the successful integration of an interactive disco-themed UI and a responsive AI chatbot. Our ability to leverage technologies like MongoDB Atlas and the Spotify API has enhanced user engagement. Additionally, creating an immersive choose-your-own-adventure game showcases our innovative approach to education.

## What We Learned

- **MongoDB Atlas**: We learned how to set up and manage a cloud-based database, which allows us to store user data and application content efficiently.
- **Spotify API**: We explored how to integrate the Spotify API, enabling users to access and add disco tracks to their playlists directly from our application.
- **AI Chat Models**: We utilized AI chat models to create DiscoAI, our interactive chatbot that engages users by answering questions and enhancing their learning experience.
